# guess that states in the U.S. game

## this is may plan...

* display the chart
* run the loop until the user has guessed all the 50 states  
* prompt the user to enter a state
* change the entered state to tile case  
* check to see if the state is in the table
* if it is in the table, send a turtle to that location and tell it 
to print the name of the state
* i think we can use one turtle to do all the printing
as long as we have its pen and it is moving fast enough
